With TechEnhance, I worked on a WordPress website for a company called StorageDNA. My task was to design the service pages. I designed two pages: Smart Analysis Tools and Meta & Proxy Management.

### Project 5: Homeportal (Canada)
**Client:** Megan Rekhi, Founder

**Duration:** Jan 2025 – Apr 2025

**Description:**
At Home Portal, I handled a wide range of real-world tasks that involved both technical implementation and creative problem-solving. My role included building custom post types for real estate listings, implementing a fully functional map search feature using ACF and Leaflet.js, and customizing Elementor layouts for performance and design consistency.

I also optimized image grids, created archive pages using both Elementor and custom code, and developed dynamic filters and responsive layouts. One of the biggest challenges I solved was extracting structured property data from HTML tables and integrating it into a searchable, map-based frontend without relying on external plugins or lat/lng fields. I worked closely with SEO and content teams to auto-generate missing ALT text for thousands of images using AI and automated workflows in Make.com.

Beyond coding, I focused on scalability, UI/UX improvements, and SEO-friendly structuring - delivering real impact to the business website through practical, hands-on solutions.
