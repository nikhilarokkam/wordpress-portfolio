### Project 1: RA CAP
**Client:** RA CAP

**Description:**
RA CAP is a finance advisory firm located in Bhubaneswar. This was my first WordPress project, and I was completely new to WordPress at the timeâ€”a noob actually! Thanks to Battina Abhishek Bhaiyya who trusted me, I managed to complete the project and gained a little confidence from there.

### Project 3: StorageDNA

However, my tenure with TechEnhance was only one week due to my need to focus on my final year college project.
